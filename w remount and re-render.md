## Yes 👍 remount and re-render are different in React. Let’s break it down:

---

## 🔹 Re-render

1. Happens when props/state change inside an already mounted component.

2. React does not destroy the component — it just updates the UI with new props/state.

## Lifecycle:

1. Component stays alive.

2. useEffect with dependencies may re-run (after cleanup).

3. State (useState) values are preserved.

## 👉 Example:

If <Cards selectedCategory="movies" /> updates to <Cards selectedCategory="books" /> without a key, React just re-renders the same <Cards> instance with new props.
Your cache (inside useRef) is preserved.

---

## 🔹 Remount

Happens when React destroys the old component and creates a new one from scratch.

State and refs are reset (fresh instance).

Lifecycle:

Old component’s cleanup runs (like useEffect cleanup).

New component is created and mounted.

👉 Example:
If you give <Cards key={selectedCategory} selectedCategory={selectedCategory} />,

When selectedCategory changes → React sees the key is different → destroys old component → mounts a fresh one.

Now cache inside useRef is lost (because it belonged to the destroyed instance).

---

## NOTE:-

Unmount only destroys the component.

React removes it from the UI.

Cleanup functions run.

State and refs are lost.

It does NOT automatically create a new component.

---

Remount = Unmount + Mount

Old component is destroyed.

A brand new component instance is created with fresh state/refs
